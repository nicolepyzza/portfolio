                I'm an experienced DevOps and Site Reliability Engineer with a knack for managing infrastructure. With nearly 4 years of experience in the cloud universe,
                I've honed my skills in Terraform, AWS, Jenkins, and navigating through intricate and complex projects.

                When I'm not diving into the world of technology, you can find me lost in a world of words. I'm a passionate reader and writer. With every project I tackle,
                I bring that same creativity to the table.
                <br/> <br/>
                Additionally, I have just over 5 years of marketing experience. This showcases my success in high-pressure environments,
                managing tight deadlines and going above and beyond for every client.
